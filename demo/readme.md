These files demonstrate how to use the Discrete Integral Transform approach described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107476

Run `show_spectrum.py` for a demonstration of the integral transform.

`HITEMP_spectra.py` contains functions to load HITEMP data and produce the stick spectrum.

`discrete_integral_transform.py` contains the methods described in the paper.

The demo needs HITEMP database files to run. These can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.iao.ru/pub/CDSD-HITEMP/
