Run `show_spectrum.py` for a demonstration of the integral transform.

`HITEMP_spectra.py` contains functions to load HITEMP data and produce the stick spectrum.

`discrete_integral_transform.py` contains the methods described in the paper.


The demo needs HITEMP database files to run. These can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.iao.ru/pub/CDSD-HITEMP/
