Notes:

Matrix calculation:
- py1 vs py2: Get indices by division of dx is a little faster (~10%) 
- py2 vs cy1: Replacing add_at with cython version is MUCH faster, 1200ms vs 200ms.
- cy1 vs cpp1: Cython add_at vs cpp version: no difference.
- cy0 vs cpp2: Cyhton version a little faster (30 ms vs 35 ms)
- cy0 vs cpp2+SIMD: cython version was a little faster (30ms vs 35 ms)
For now: cy0 comes out ahead, SIMD tried at some point, but not included in this report.
